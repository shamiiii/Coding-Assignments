This assignment involved writing a program that could read and identify the numbers of a four number captcha. 
This program does not use machine learning, but instead uses a series of functions that attempts to identify the defining characteristics
of a number and uses a decision tree to separate and identify each digit. The purpose was not to achieve 100% accuracy but to be
as accurate as possible and solve the most captchas without machine learning. The main code is in the file captcha.c, and every other
file contains a function used in the main code.
